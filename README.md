## usage

Install the package.

```
npm install -g phone-keys-wallet
```

It provides the `collect` command. Which gets stuff in place, where it should
be before you start with your work.

1. Brings your `package.json` to a default format
- adds scripts, etc.


2. copies support files to your repo from your home to the project.

```
['.editorconfig', '.eslintrc', '.gitignore', 'LICENSE']
```
